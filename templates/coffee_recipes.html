  <h3>Recipe:</h3>
  <p>
    There isn't a recipe I can recommend for a perfect pour-over coffee.
    With so many variables in equipment, you just have to taste a lot of coffee, and know what you are looking for out of your brew.
    Also the tools required for repeatable brews are more expensive than the other brew methods.
    I recommend that beginner brewers try one of the other methods, and if they fall in love with brewing their coffee, to invest in a nice pour-over set up.
