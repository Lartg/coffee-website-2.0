        <p class="card-text text-muted">Categories of Brewing</p>
        <p class="card-text">
          Brewing coffee or tea is the act of extracting material from plant cells,
          usually with water.
          There are two ways to brew:
          One is infusion, kind of like a bath.
          Plant matter is soaked in water and material diffuses throughout the solution.
          The second is percolation, kind of like a shower.
          Water is poured over the plant matter and a filter, carrying what dissolves
          -and can pass through the filter- into your cup.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text text-muted">Qualities of a good extraction</p>
        <p class="card-text">
          A good extraction is balanced.
          The highly soluble molecules -acids and caffeine-
          work with the less soluble materials -sugars, oils, and tannins-
          to give us a well balanced cup.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text"> 
          A cup that is sour is under extracted. The acidity is not tempered by the sweetness of sugars,
          or the bitterness of the oils and tannins. An under extracted cup is thin, it lacks the thickening
          of these oils.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          On the otherside of things, an over extracted cup is unbearably bitter.
          The tannins and oils overwhelm the acidity and sweetness that can be found in a cup of coffee,
          but marry all the parts and you can experience something wonderful.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          Coffee contains over 800 aromatic compounds. Wine contains around 400. If you've heard ravings
          of the diversity of good wine, imagine how complex a fine single origin speciality coffee can be.

          When learning to brew, it is important to change one variable at a time to understand its impact on brews.

        <h3 class="card-title">Grind</h3>
        <p class="card-text text-muted">TLDR: Big grind = brew slow, small grind = brew fast</p>
        <p class="card-text">
          To make the transfer of material efficient, a high surface area to volume ratio is required.
          Think of a warehouse. 
          A big warehouse with lots of space, but with no garage doors is a bad warehouse.
          A smaller warehouse with garage doors large enough for trucks to back up to is a good warehouse.
          The same can be said for volume and surface-area.
          To make the math simpler, let's use a cube. 
          Volume = s^3
          Surface-area = 6s^2
          The closer S is to zero, the larger the ratio of surface-area : volume.
          Therefore, if all other brewing variables are held constant, the changes to extraction are as follows:
          When grind-size is increased, less soluble material is extracted from the coffee.
          When grind-size is decreased, more soluble material is extracted from the coffee.
          If your coffee is too bitter, try increasing your grind size.
          If your coffee is sour, try decreasing your grind size.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          Now in order to accurately control your grind, I recommend purchasing a burr grinder.
          They may be a lot more expensive than a blade grinder, and thats for a reason.
          Blade grinders cut coffee into randomly sized bits, while burr grinders crush coffee into particles into a regular size.

        <h3 class="card-title">Dose</h3>
        <p class="card-text text-muted">TLDR: more coffee -> stronger coffee</p>
        <p class="card-text">
          Although dose can be used to affect flavor, I don't recommend it. 
          A typical 12oz cup of coffee is dosed with around 20g of coffee.
          Whenever you play with dose, you play with how much caffeine you are ingesting.
          Both overcaffienation, and undercaffinnation can be a bad time.
          I recommend a scale for dosing as volumetric measurements are less consistent.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          However, Increasing dose will increase flow resistance in a coffee filter, leading to more contact time with water,
          leading to more materials being extracted. 
          Increasing dose can also lead to a thicker cup of coffee, although if this is a problem for you I would recommend trying a french press.
          If your coffee is too thick, I recommend using a paper filter. There are many different filters on the market
          that differ in thickness, and how much oils and such they let through without affecting your caffeine. 
          A Chemex filter yields a tea-like brew, whereas a Hario v60 has more body.
          I advise you find a level of caffeine that you like, and stick with it. Change other variables for flavor adjustments.

        <h3 class="card-title">Time</h3>
        <p class="card-text text-muted">TLDR: More time = more extraction</p>
        <p class="card-text">
          The more time grounds spend in contact with water, the more soluble material is extracted.
          This means that using a timer for hand brews is key for consistency.
          Most "coffee scales" have built in timers. 
          But if you're using your kitchen scale, just start a stopwatch on your phone.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          For percolation:
          In a drip machine, flow rate is usually fixed. This means that if you were to brew a pot
          instead of a single brew, there would be much more contact time with the water and ground coffee.
          To balance this change of brew time, increase your grind-size. With percolation, the longer it takes the bigger your grind should be.
          Think of espresso. It takes 30s and the grounds are almost a powder. Small time, small grind.
          For drip: big time, big grind.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          For Infusion:
          Making a good infusion brew is all about marrying your grind-size and time.
          If you dont feel like changing your grind and purging your grinder, you can just play with the time that you steep your coffee.
          And as you read in the TLDR, more time = more extraction.

        <p class="card-text text-muted">TLDR: More heat = more extraction</p>
        <p class="card-text">
          The temperature of water is indicitive of how much energy the water contains.
          The more energy available, the faster the water is able to dissolve solutes.
          Think about washing dishes. Do you use hot water, or cold water?
          Having inconsistent water temperature means inconsistent brews. 
          I recommend brewing at around 205 degrees faraihnheit, and an electric kettle makes hitting a consistent temperature incredibly easy.

            As soon as you grind coffee, you break apart the cells, exposing more surface area to air. &nbsp;
            This rapidly increases the oxidation rate of the coffee. &nbsp;
            After some time the coffee becomes stale, flat. &nbsp;
            Coffee is a fresh food, and sometimes we forget that. &nbsp;
            If possible, pick up a coffee grinder.&nbsp;
            A blade grinder can cost as low as $15, while a high quality domestic burr grinder averages $100.&nbsp;
            How much you invest into your experience is up to you.

            Cream, sugar, etc.&nbsp;
            If you have a good brewing set-up, often you don't need it -taste wise-.&nbsp;
            If you are sensitive to acidic foods, then milk or cream is definitely something you should add to your coffee.&nbsp;
            The basic dairy helps balance your tummy. &nbsp;
            I will recommend buying smaller quantities of milk/cream to ensure freshness at all times.&nbsp;
            If you don't like bitter things, adding sugar -or a sugar substitute- is not shameful.&nbsp;
            However, if your brew is unbearably bitter, you are probably doing something wrong. &nbsp;
            Pay attention to the recipes!
