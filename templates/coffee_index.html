          <h4>Cheaper</h4>
          <p>A 12oz latte costs -on average- $4.00. &nbsp;
            However, ~$17 nets a 1 lbs bag of whole bean, speciality coffee. &nbsp;
            That comes out to ~23 cups of coffee/bag, or ~$0.75/cup. &nbsp;
            It's even cheaper when buying commercial coffee in bulk. &nbsp;
            Coffee is a commodity. &nbsp;
            It's cheap. &nbsp;
            Coffee being expensive at a cafe is a result of the accrued costs of running a business.

          <p>
            On average it takes a 10 minute round trip for me to get to a cafe from my house.&nbsp;
            Factor in ~5 minutes in line, and ~5 minutes until I get my drink, and I've spent 20 minutes getting coffee.
            &nbsp;
            At home I can brew coffee in less than 5 minutes, saving time and money.

            Something about the routine of brewing is satsfying and calming. &nbsp;
            But beyond that, one is able -with experience- to control variables of brewing to curtail their recipe to
            perfectly match their tastes.
