          <h4>Cheaper</h4>
          <p>A 12oz latte costs -on average- $4.00. &nbsp;
            However, ~$17 nets a 1 lbs bag of whole bean, speciality coffee. &nbsp;
            That comes out to ~23 cups of coffee/bag, or ~$0.75/cup. &nbsp;
            It's even cheaper when buying commercial coffee in bulk. &nbsp;
            Coffee is a commodity. &nbsp;
            It's cheap. &nbsp;
            Coffee being expensive at a cafe is a result of the accrued costs of running a business.

            On average it takes a 10 minute round trip for me to get to a cafe from my house.&nbsp;
            Factor in ~5 minutes in line, and ~5 minutes until I get my drink, and I've spent 20 minutes getting coffee.
            &nbsp;
            At home I can brew coffee in less than 5 minutes, saving time and money.

          <p>
            Something about the routine of brewing is satsfying and calming. &nbsp;
            But beyond that, one is able -with experience- to control variables of brewing to curtail their recipe to
            perfectly match their tastes.

          Brewing coffee or tea is the act of extracting material from plant cells,
          usually with water.
          There are two ways to brew:
          One is infusion, kind of like a bath.
          Plant matter is soaked in water and material diffuses throughout the solution.
          The second is percolation, kind of like a shower.
          Water is poured over the plant matter and a filter, carrying what dissolves
          -and can pass through the filter- into your cup.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4 id="extract-header">Qualities of a good extraction</h4>
      <div id="extract-overview">
        <div id="extract-p-container">
          <p>
            A good extraction is balanced.
            The highly soluble molecules -acids and caffeine-
            work with the less soluble materials -sugars, oils, and tannins-
            to give us a well balanced cup.
          </p>
          <p>
            A cup that is sour is under extracted. The acidity is not tempered by the sweetness of sugars,
            or the bitterness of the oils and tannins. An under extracted cup is thin, it lacks the thickening
            of these oils.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the otherside of things, an over extracted cup is unbearably bitter.
            The tannins and oils overwhelm the acidity and sweetness that can be found in a cup of coffee,
            but marry all the parts and you can experience something wonderful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Coffee contains over 800 aromatic compounds. Wine contains around 400. If you've heard ravings
            of the diversity of good wine, imagine how complex a fine single origin speciality coffee can be.
